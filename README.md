# DevSecOps

## TL;DR
My personal collection of DevSecOps docs, scripts, and random stuff I keep forgetting, well it's not polished I just stash everything I find useful (troubleshooting notes, Dockerfiles, Vagrant tricks, Kubernetes CS, ...)

## What's in here?

Just the usual DevOps things I need to reference when my brain fails me:

- Infrastructure setup notes, templates, configs ...
- Security stuff I use everywhere
- Random scripts that save time
- ...


## Notes to future me

- Document the weird edge cases you discover
- Keep the scripts simple and readable
- Back up the working configs before "improving" them

That's it. Nothing fancy, just practical stuff that works !!!
